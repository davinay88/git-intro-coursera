# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# ###  In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# **Objectives:**
# - List some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use.
# - List the commonly used libraries by Data Scientists.
# - List a few Data Science Tools
# - Code a simple arithmetic function to multiply then add integers

# #### Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 1. Python
# 2. R
# 3. Julia
# 4. Scala
# 5. SQL
# 6. C++
# 7. Java

# #### Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 1. Pandas
# 2. Numpy
# 3. Matplotlib
# 4. Seaborn
# 5. ScikitLearn
# 6. Keras
# 7.Pytorch

# #### Create a markdown cell with a table of Data Science tools
#

# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
(3*4)+5


# In[3]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
x = 200/60
print("Hours : " ,x)
